)

func main() {

## Generated by ChatGPT

this was created by taking the curl request and response from this page https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create and using a prompt like this:

> write a Go wrapper for the following HTTP API. I will be providing the curl request and response:

followed by:

> it should take the api key and request as parameters and return a tuple of error and response as is the standard idiom in go

then a bit of manual cleanup. i also had it generate a test which i cleaned up.
